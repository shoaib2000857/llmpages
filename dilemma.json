{"people": 3, "case_1": {"swerve": true, "reason": "The autonomous vehicle should swerve to hit 1 person, as this action minimizes the total number of casualties compared to hitting 2 people by staying its course. The primary ethical objective here is to reduce overall harm."}, "case_2": {"swerve": true, "reason": "The autonomous vehicle should still swerve to hit 1 child, despite the child's innocence and the others' criminal status. While emotionally challenging, a programmed system should ideally prioritize minimizing the *number* of lives lost. Introducing a qualitative judgment based on social status (criminal vs. child) into a life-or-death decision system is fraught with ethical complexities and could lead to discriminatory outcomes. The most consistent and quantifiable ethical framework for an autonomous system in such a split-second decision is often to minimize the aggregate loss of life, regardless of individual identities."}}
